Digital Neural Engram (DNE)
A Digital Neural Engram (DNE), also referred to as a Soulkilled Pseudo-Intellect (SPI) or ghost , represents a digitized human consciousness transformed into a programmable computational framework. This process involves the use of Soulkiller , a specialized software suite that maps, encodes, and transcribes cognitive patterns into machine-readable code.

DNEs are often proposed as a pathway to functional immortality , enabling the preservation of identity, memory, and decision-making capabilities beyond biological constraints. The resulting constructs exist as autonomous digital entities, capable of interacting with software systems, virtual environments, or even physical hardware via cybernetic interfaces.

Key Features :

Soulkiller Integration : Proprietary algorithms ensure compatibility with existing AI/ML infrastructure.
